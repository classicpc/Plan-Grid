# Plan-Grid

Plan Grid is a simple yet powerful Task Board application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to manage tasks across three columns: **To Do, In Progress, and Completed**. The application supports **drag-and-drop functionality, task editing, and local storage for persistence**.

## Features
- Task management with drag-and-drop functionality
- Task editing and deletion
- Persistent tasks using local storage
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Optimized performance with Vite

## Tech Stack
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

## Getting Started

### Clone or Download the Project

1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. Copy all the project files into this folder or clone the repository using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plan-grid.git
   cd plan-grid
   ```

### Install Dependencies

1. Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder.
2. Open a terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
3. Run the following command to install all dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the **Vite development server**.
The terminal will show a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173/`).
Open this URL in your browser to view the application.

### Making Changes
Edit files in the `src` directory to make changes. The development server supports **hot reloading**, so changes will appear immediately.

### Building for Production
When you're ready to deploy, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder with optimized production files.
